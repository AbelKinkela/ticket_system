# ticket_system
This python program automates tickets requests and processing for an Audio Visual(AV) university department. The AV team members, University Admin and University faculty staff are the main users of the system. University Admin and Faculty log into the system and make AV equiment requests by creating a request. Any AV team member can create a ticket once a request is made by Admin and Staff. This ticket can then be assigned to a member of the team for further processing. Comments can be added along the way and Admin and Staff are able to track progress on their requests and are informed when they can collect the AV equipment requested. Authentication, Authorization and accounting are properly handled and System Admin has all the priveleges.
